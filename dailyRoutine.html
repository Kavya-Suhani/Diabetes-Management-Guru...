        <h2>In the Morning</h2>
        <div class="morning">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Check Your blood sugar: </b>If you have type 2 diabetes, you should check your blood sugar level every morning before you eat, it gives you a good baseline idea where you stand and allows you to make adjustments throughout the day. </li>
                <li><b>Take you medications on time: </b>Whether it's morning or night, aim to take your basal insulin at the same time each day, Consistency is what really matters!</li>
                <li><b>Eat breakfast â€” and also take a look forward in your day: </b> If you skip breakfast, you're already starting your day on the wrong foot and it's one of the most important meals of the day. In fact, while eating regular meals will help keep your blood sugar levels steady, skipping them and then binging later can cause spikes, it is observed that doctors put people on standard doses of diabetes medications for meals, and as the meals fluctuate, they can be at risk for high blood sugar or low blood sugar.</li>
                <li><b>Give your feet a once-over: </b>Over time, high blood sugar can cause nerve damage and loss of sensation in your feet and if unnoticed, cut can become severely infected. Check your feet for any sores or cuts each morning and night. Also check your shoes before putting them on to make sure there's nothing in your shoe that could cause a sore.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>In the Afternoon</h2>
        <div class="afternoon">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Take a satisfying lunch break: </b>Plan a healthy lunch ahead of time or you might resort to unhealthy fast food. The regular meal and the exercise help keep your blood sugar level stable, and you can release some pressure from work. Remember to take a short walk afterwards!</li>
                <li><b>Have healthy snacks on hand: </b>Plan a healthy lunch ahead of time or you might resort to unhealthy fast food. The regular meal and the exercise help keep your blood sugar level stable, and you can release some pressure from work. Remember to take a short walk afterwards!</li>
                <li><b>Get a little extra activity: </b>Take the stairs instead of an elevator. Get up from your desk and go talk to co-workers instead of emailing them. Experts recommend getting 30 minutes of physical activity each day, but it doesn't have to be all at once. Every time you get up and move around, you're adding to your 30-minute total. If you're worn out from work, try to fit in a short walk in the late afternoon.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>In the Evening</h2>
        <div class="evening">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Eat a sensible dinner: </b>Don't overeat, eat a meal that's about the same size as what you ate for breakfast and lunch or at least make sure the meal fits into the larger eating strategy or plan that you've developed with your healthcare team. The actual amounts of protein, carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables you should eat will depend on the meal plan that's best for you. As with earlier in the day, maintaining a steady intake of food will make you less vulnerable to blood sugar spikes, especially if you're eating healthy foods.</li>
                <li><b>Keep moving while you watch TV or listen to a book on tape: </b>The goal is to stay in motion. Even physical activity that's not aerobic can help your body's ability to use insulin efficiently, and keep your blood sugar levels stable.</li>
            </ul>
